# Family Golf Club Website Replica

This is a personal project where I attempted to recreate a replica of an original website, [Sidcup Family Golf Club](https://sidcupfamilygolf.com/).

You can check out this project live at [https://syed-mohd-askari.github.io/Family-Golf-Club-Website/](https://syed-mohd-askari.github.io/Family-Golf-Club-Website/).

**Note:** The website may not load properly on the first attempt; if this occurs, please refresh the page, and it should load completely.

## Features

- Changed Scrollbar Theme to look exactly like website
- Added cursor movements and animations
- Added Scrolling Animations using gsap
- Added Text Effects and Text Strokes
- Added Hover animations to match original website animations
